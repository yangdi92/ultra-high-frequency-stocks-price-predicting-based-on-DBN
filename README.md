This paper discusses the definition and characteristics of high-frequency finance data firstly. We find that the intensity of the transaction, that is, the duration of the transaction shows a U pattern and the daily cycle. The high-peak and heavy-tail phenomenon is found in empirical distribution of high frequency finance data and the change of trading price is focused. These characteristics lead to the traditional time series models have poor performance on accuracy of forecasting.
In order to forecast the high-frequency share price more precisely, this paper uses the deep learning models which can better extract the data features of high-frequency share price to predict. The history, theoretical basis and model classification of deep learning are introduced in detail in this paper. The center of the paper focuses on structure of Restricted Boltzmann Machine, maximum likelihood learning strategy and the approximate gradient of likelihood function based on Gibbs sampling and contrastive divergence learning. In the selection of the index to predict the high-frequency stock price, this paper has reference to the existing literatures, and chooses first four historical stock prices. With increasing time prediction and deep belief network model prediction accuracy has almost no change, and the prediction precision of the other two models showing a downward trend. It also illustrates the deep learning model can in some extent avoid the overfitting phenomenon.
This paper constructs a deep confidence network with three layers finally. We find that the model can fit the price trend of high-frequency finance. At the same time, we compare the forecasting ability of deep belief networks, neural networks and ARMA in 10, 20 and 30 minutes. With increasing prediction interval, the forecasting accuracy of deep belief network has almost no change, and the prediction precision of the other two models showing a downward trend. It also illustrates the deep learning model can in some extent avoid the over-fitting phenomenon.
